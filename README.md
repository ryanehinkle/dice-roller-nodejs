**Dice Roller** is a simple application for simulating the randomized rolling of two
six sided die.

### The server makes use of these files:
- static -> index.html
- package.json
- web.config

This is the server side application. It is created using Node.js and Express to server the client
side application in generating random numbers for the dice roller program/function.

All work is original and written by me.
